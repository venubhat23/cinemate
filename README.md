## 🛠 Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following scripts:

### `npm start`
Runs the app in development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `npm test`
Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.  
For more information, see the [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) section.

### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.  
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.  
The build is minified, and filenames include hashes. Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm run eject`
**Note: This is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**  
If you’re not satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project and give you full control over the configuration files.
